Tiny scallops just arent very exciting. *Ground chili paste can usually be found in your markets Asian products aisle (I used one called Sambal Oelek).

Stir to combine. The mixture may seem too wet, but the chicken will absorb some of the sauce. To make the dough: Combine the warm milk and brown sugar in a measuring cup, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the flour, yeast and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on low briefly just to combine. With the mixer on low, gradually pour the milk/sugar mixture into the mixer and beat until a rough dough forms. Switch from the paddle attachment to the dough hook. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. You want the dough to clear the sides of the bowl as it kneads - if its not, add a tablespoon of flour at a time until it does. The dough should be tacky, but not sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into a ball. Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray and add the ball of dough, turning to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 90 minutes. You can tell if the dough has doubled by sticking your finger in and making an impression. If the impression remains, you are ready to move on, but if it springs back, the dough hasnt risen enough. Preheat oven to 400 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into a 12-inch rope. Use your fingers to flatten the dough into a rectangular shape, then use a rolling pin to roll to a roughly 12x4-inch rectangle.

Flour tortillas can just be heated slightly before filling them or placing them in baking dish with a small amount of enchilada sauce when making casserole. To make regular enchiladas: Place some enchilada sauce in the bottom of baking dish THEN place about a TBLS of meat in each tortilla, some cheese, chiles, onions, and sour cream and some enchilada sauce. Roll and place each one in a baking dish. Top with enchilada sauce, sour cream, cheese, a few olives and heat until bubbly or about 30 minutes. To make the casserole: Place some enchilada sauce on the bottom of pan. Place a layer of tortillas, meat, cheese. chiles, onions, and sour cream. Add another layer of tortillas and meat, etc if you have enough. If not just place a few tortillas on top. THEN place more sauce, sour cream. cheese, and chiles and a few olives sprinkled over all.

Then, over medium-low heat, whisk in the chocolate. The result is a homogenous sauce. Put the saucepan in a bowl partly filled with ice cubes (or pour into another bowl over the ice -- it will chill faster), then whisk the chocolate sauce, either manually with a whisk or with an electric mixer (if using an electric mixer, watch closely -- it will thicken faster). Whisking creates large air bubbles in the sauce, which steadily thickens. After a while strands of chocolate form inside the loops of the whisk. Pour or spoon immediately into ramekins, small bowls or jars and let set. Note: Three things can go wrong. Heres how to fix them. If your chocolate doesnt contain enough fat, melt the mixture again, add some chocolate, and then whisk it again. If the mousse is not light enough, melt the mixture again, add some water, and whisk it once more. If you whisk it too much, so that it becomes grainy, this means that the foam has turned into an emulsion. In that case simply melt the mixture and whisk it again, adding nothing. Serve immediately, or refrigerate. Top with whipped cream if desired You can get different textures depending on when you stop whisking: 1) For a mod, flat-topped look, like sexy pot de creme: pour it into ramekins while its thickened, but still a bit warm. 2) When it gets to the texture of thick pudding, you can spoon it into a glass parfait-style, like little chocolate snowdrifts (as in our photos). At this stage, our Assistant Editor Nozlee Samadzadeh has also used it to frost a cake. 3) Whip it just a bit further for something fluffy you can ball up in an ice cream scoop, if thats what youre going for. Beyond this, and it gets crumbly and dry (though still tasty).';

REPLACE INTO `Directions` SET `ID`='977', `RecipeID`='977', `SortOrder`='0', `Directions`='1. Prepare the cheesecake layer: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place a large roasting pan on the lower third rack of the oven. Place a kettle of water on the stove to boil. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. Wrap a double layer of foil around the bottom and up the sides of the pan (you want to seal it so the water from the water bath doesnt seep into the pan). In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to mix the cream cheese- blend until it is nice and smooth and creamy. Mix in sugar and salt and blend for 2 minutes, scraping down sides of the bowl as needed. Add eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition. Finally, mix in sour cream, whipping cream and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the pan into the roasting pan in the pre-heated oven. Carefully pour the hot water from your kettle into the roasting pan (it will fill the pan surrounding the cheesecake). Pour enough water so that there is about an inch of water coming up the foil along the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake the cheesecake for 45 minutes. It should be set to the touch and not jiggly. Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour. When it has cooled, place the pan into the freezer and let the cheesecake freeze completely. This can be done in several hours- or overnight. 2. Prepare the cake layers: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round metal baking pans (or spray with nonstick baking spray with flour). In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Add eggs, oil, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and vinegar to the flour mixture. Using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat for 1 minute, until blended. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans, dividing equally. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Let cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pans, then invert cakes onto a rack to cool completely. 3. Prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter and vanilla until it is smooth and creamy (do not overbeat). 4. Assemble the cake: Place one cake layer into the center of a cake plate or platter. Remove the cheesecake from the freezer, take off the sides of the pan, and slide a knife under the parchment to remove the cheesecake from the pan. Peel off the parchment. Measure your cheesecake layer against the cake layers. If the cheesecake layer turns out to be a slightly larger round than your cake, move it to a cutting board and gently shave off some of the exterior of the cheesecake to get it to the same size as your cake layers. Place the cheesecake layer on top of the first cake layer. Place the 2nd cake layer on top of the cheesecake. 5. Frost the cake: Apply a crumb coat layer to the cake- use a long, thin spatula to cover the cake completely with a thin and even layer of frosting. Be sure to wipe off your spatula each time you are about to dip it back into the bowl to get more frosting (this way you wont be transferring any red crumbs into the bowl of frosting). dont worry at this point about the crumbs being visible in the frosting on the cake. When your cake has a thin layer of frosting all over it, place it into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set the frosting. Once the first layer of frosting is set, apply the 2nd layer. Start by adding a large scoop of frosting onto the top of the cake. Use a long, thin spatula to spread the frosting evenly across the top and then spread it down the sides of the cake too. Because you applied a crumb-coat layer, you shouldnt have any red crumbs floating around in the final frosting layer. Decorate, as desired. I recommend white chocolate shavings (see *Tips below). Keep this cake refrigerated. Tips: *For making white chocolate shavings: Purchase a hunk of white chocolate. Microwave the chocolate to soften it up slightly (15 to 30 seconds, depending on the size). Use a potato peeler to run down the side of the chocolate to create shards/shaves/curls of white chocolate. I like to shave it onto a paper plater and then just use the plate to slide the chocolate onto the top of the cake. *If you are serving this cake at a party, its perfectly okay to leave the cake at room temperature for an hour or so while serving. Otherwise, keep it in the refrigerator. It also freezes perfectly! I made my cake one day and then just placed it as-is in the freezer and pulled it out the next day. It thaws quickly. more at recipegirl.com';

Line a 9 X 13 inch pan with a double layer of foil, leaving enough foil hang over the edge so youll be able to grab onto it to lift the brownies out of the pan later. Spray foil lightly with cooking spray. In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Return the mixture to the heat briefly, just till its hot, but not bubbling; itll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heat the butter and sugar a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Stir in the cocoa, salt, baking powder and vanilla, Add the eggs, beating till smooth: then add the flour and chocolate chips, beating will well combined. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Bake the brownies for 28 to 30 minutes, (this took more like 35 minutes for me) until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out dry (though it may have a few crumbs clinging to it). The brownies should feel set both on the edges, and in the center. Remove them from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges with a table knife; this helps prevent the brownies from sinking in the center as they cool. When brownies have cooled, lift them out of the pan by grabbing on to both ends of the foil. Lay foiled brownies on a flat surface. With a biscuit cutter or deep cookie cutter, cut out rounds of brownie and place on a cooling rack that has been placed over a sheet of wax paper. In double boiler, melt about 18 ounces of chocolate chips plus a tablespoon or so of shortening until smooth. Drop a tablespoon of the melted chocolate on top of each mini-brownie and allow it to flow over the sides. Smooth sides with a knife. Set aside to cool. I put mine in the freezer for a few minutes. Meanwhile combine about 6 ounces of caramel bits with a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream in a microwave dish. Microwave in 30 second increments until caramel is melted and smooth.

If you make them yourself, I don’t think you will ever go back to purchasing taco shells. All you need is some tortillas and cooking spray. We used some small, soft “taco” tortillas. We used the flour kind but corn is fine too. First you want to steam them… Wet some paper towels and wring them out well. Layer the tortillas with the wet paper towels on a plate and then microwave (we did 6 at a time). Keep an eye on them, it should be about 30 seconds until they are steamed. Then lightly spray each side with cooking spray and drape each tortilla over two bars of the oven rack. It is wise to put a baking sheet below them to catch any oil from the cooking spray. Bake at 350-375 degrees for 7-10 minutes. You will be able to tell that they are browning & getting crispy. Take them out and set them aside! Okay, now for the filling All you need is ground beef (2 pounds), 1 can of refried beans, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 packet of taco seasoning, shredded cheese, & your favorite taco toppings. Brown the ground beef in a large skillet. COMPLETELY drain all grease and return to skillet. Over low heat, add refried beans, taco seasoning, and about half to two-thirds of the tomato sauce (you can eye this to see whats best, you don’t want the filling to be too runny or your tacos will be soggy on the bottoms). Blend well and scoop into the tacos (which should be “standing” in a lightly greased casserole type dish). Then just sprinkle the cheese over the top and bake.

Heat a large saucepan under medium high heat and melt the butter. Add the carrot, celery, onion, and country ham. Do not skip the country ham. I think it really gives the sauce a depth of flavor that you don’t get with just plain mirepoix. However, do watch your salt – since the ham is cured, it’s pretty salty to begin with, so you may not even have to season with any additional (I didn’t). Cook the vegetables until they are starting to become tender and the onions are translucent. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Cook roux for about 10 minutes, or until it begins a nice nutty brown color. Slowly stir in your beef stock, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Add tomato paste, parsley stems, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Leave partially covered and simmer for at least an hour to develop flavors. Skim off any fat or scum as you see fit. When the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, strain the liquid of the solids. Season to taste and keep warm until ready to use. While your sauce is simmering, you can caramelize your onions and cook your bacon. Melt the butter in a large saute pan under medium heat. Add onions and cook under low to medium heat until caramelized and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Don’t rush the onions, the slower they cook, the sweeter and tastier they’ll be. You don’t want any browning, so be sure to stir them every so often. Place onions in a medium bowl to cool. Heat a small skillet under medium heat and add your strips of bacon. Cook until crisp, then remove with a slotted spoon, transferring to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. When bacon is dry, add in with onions. Reserve about 3 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat from the pan. Add shredded cheese to bowl with onions and bacon and mix well. Taste for seasoning. Place the flank steak horizontally in front of you (so that it is widest). Spread the mustard atop the steak. Place an even layer of the filling over top of the mustard. Roll the steak up, like a jelly roll, keeping it as tight as possible. Cut in half and tie each roulade like a roast with some kitchen twine. Season the roulade with salt and pepper.

For me this was about ⅓ cup refried beans, 1 cup of the chicken, ½ cup cheese, and about ¾ cup enchilada sauce in each layer. Cover the top with the remaining enchilada sauce and 1 cup cheese. Cover the baking dish with well-oiled aluminum foil and bake for about 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake uncovered for an additional 5 minutes or until cheese is starting to brown and sauce is bubbling. Allow to rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving (otherwise it will be a soupy mess – delicious, but not ideal)';

REPLACE INTO `Directions` SET `ID`='2070', `RecipeID`='2070', `SortOrder`='0', `Directions`='1 To kick off the construction of this pork medley youll need to create a 5x5 bacon weave. If the strips youre using arent wide enough to span 5x5 inches, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern. Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with. 2 The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave. (BBQ Addict recommends Bad Byrons Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlens All-Purpose Rub). 3 Now that youre pork is well seasoned, its time to add more pork. Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave. Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across. Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like. 4 Next up is bacon layer number two. Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast. If you like soft bacon, make it soft. If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy. 5 Since this is a barbecue recipe, we need to add another layer of barbecue flavor. Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces. (BBQ Addict recommends Burnt Finger BBQs homemade competition sauce). Once youve sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbecue seasoning you used on the bacon weave. 6 Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards. You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll. Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed. Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside. 7 At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but were missing one key item. To complete the construction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave. Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up. 8 Sprinkle some barbecue seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now it is ready for the smoker. Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225°F in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your meat thermometer gives an internal temperature reading of 165°F Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek. BBQ Addict recommends 2.5 hours, for a roll 2.5 inches in diameter. 9 Now that the Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, you need to add some finishing flavors. Remember that barbecue sauce you used for inner flavor? youll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave. Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce. Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so theyll give your fatty a nice glossy finish. Spicy and vinegar based sauces dont contain as much, so they wont set up as well. If youre dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and youll get the same effect. 10 Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve. If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.';

Let the shrimp marinate for 30-60 minutes, flipping the bag around once or twice during that time, so that all the shrimp stay evenly covered in the marinade. 3.) When youre ready to cook, take the shrimp out of the fridge and let them sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; there is no need to add any oil or butter to the pan, as the marinade has enough oil in it to keep the shrimp from sticking to the pan. (If you would prefer to use the grill for these, you can thread them onto skewers and toss them on the grill at this point.) 4.) Add your shrimp to the pan in a single layer, making sure they are not too crowded; you can always cook them in more than one batch. Let them cook on one side for about a minute, until they curl up and start to turn pink. Flip them over, and cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the shrimp are opaque.

In a bowl mix the liquid ingredients and spices, so the buttermilk, eggs, paprika, hot sauce, salt and pepper and mix really well. In another bowl, combine the baking powder and baking soda, and then whisk into the buttermilk until it becomes foamy. In a shallow dish add the flour alongside the buttermilk mixture. First dredge the chicken in the flour on all sides, then dip into the buttermilk mixture and make sure its coated well all around. Dredge the chicken in flour one more time, then place the chicken on a plate, and repeat with all chicken pieces. So its easy, flour, buttermilk, flour. If your flour gets too dirty just throw it out and start with fresh flour. In a frying pan, heat lots of oil, at least an inch. Make sure the oil is hot enough. Do not put too many pieces at once, leave enough room in between the chicken, because you dont want them to stick together. Also if you put too many chicken pieces, the chicken might not cook all the way through. The first side will take longer to cook maybe about 7 min, and the second side will cook faster, 3 to 5 minutes, so be patient and let the chicken cook properly. Repeat with remaining chicken. After the chicken is fried, place them on paper towels to soak up some of the oil and sprinkle some salt over it.';

If you need to add a little more water to completely cover the chicken, Thats not a problem. After 24 - 48 hours, remove the chicken from the brine mixture. Pat dry with paper towels. To make the flour and spice dredge simply toss the flour, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika together until completely blended. Add the brined chicken pieces to the flour dredge. Toss well and press the chicken pieces into the flour dredge with your palms to get good contact with the meat. Let stand for ten minutes, then toss again and press down with your palms again. This ensures a good crust on the chicken. Now its time to warm up your oil and butter. In a 12 inch cast iron skillet heat 1 inch canola or corn oil with ½ cup real dairy butter until it reaches 35O degrees F. Just below medium heat works well on my stove but use a thermometer to be sure. A cast iron skillet is the best for fried chicken. Be extra careful to regulate the heat properly of using anything other than cast iron. Even cooking is essential. Drop the dredged chicken pieces into the hot oil/butter mix and cook for approximately 35- 40 minutes depending on the size of your chicken pieces, turning at least once halfway through the cooking time. I start with the dark meat pieces and add the breasts about 10-15 minutes into the cooking time because these will cook faster. I always use my meat thermometer to ensure that the largest pieces have reached an internal temperature of 175 degrees F, which is perfect for fried chicken. The chicken should be a beautiful golden brown when it comes out of the oil. Let it rest on a wire rack to drain for 10 minutes before serving.';

Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour, salt, garlic powder and dried basil, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work the additional 1/2 cup flour (you dont need to use all if it is not needed) in to the dough, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a roll pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas). Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes. While the dough is rising again, melt 3 tablespoons of butter. Mix it with the garlic and 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese. Bring the dough back out and using a spoon or pastry brush, douse the outside edges with the butter and garlic mixture. You can spread the butter all over, just make sure to focus on the edges. Use it all up! Continue to make your pizza with your desired toppings. Bake the pizza for 23-25 minutes (or longer if needed, depending on your toppings), or until crust and cheese are both golden. While pizza is baking, melt remaining butter and combine with the last tablespoon of parmesan. Remove pizza from over and immediately brush the outside edges with parmesan butter, using it all up. Sprinkle a bit of parmesan over top if desired. Serve! Note: I realize that if you buy yeast in the packets, it can be a pain to measure 3 teaspoons. If you dont want to do that, I suggest making a double recipe of this crust. However! I also prefer buying jars of yeast these days instead of packets, and just keeping it in the fridge, so I suggest doing that. more at howsweeteats.com';

Stir in ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mozzarella, and the egg yolk. Mix well and set aside. 4. Lay out your long sheets of pasta on a lightly floured table. Place small balls of filling, about 1 teaspoon, in a line about one inch from the bottom of the pasta sheet. Leave about 1 1/4 inches between each ball of filling. Fold over the top of the pasta sheet, lining it with the bottom edge. Seal the bottom and 2 open sides with your finger. Use a ravioli cutter to cut out the individual raviolis. Place the ravioli on a large plate. 5. Boil a huge pot of water with salt. Add in the ravioli and cook for about 5-6 minutes. Strain and serve with the sauce of your choice. .: Side Notes :. If you have a Kitchen Aid Mixer you can use that to mix the pasta dough just make sure to use the hook attachment and keep the speed on low Feel free to add any herbs you like to the filling, when I want to change things up I normally add a little basil, rosemary or whatever else I have on hand.';

Lift it into the slow cooker: Lift the loaf by the parchment and set it in the middle of the slow cooker. Try to arrange flatten the parchment as much as possible against the sides of the slow cooker to prevent it from getting caught in the bread as it rises. Cover the slow cooker with its lid. → Pre-Baking Rise?You do not need to let your bread rise before baking. However, if your bread dough has been in the refrigerator, letting it warm a bit on the counter can reduce the overall cooking time. Set the slow cooker to HIGH: Turn on your slow cooker to the highest heat setting (or quickest time setting). Bake for 1 to 2 1/2 hours: Baking time will vary depending on your slow cooker. If this is your first time baking bread in your slow cooker, begin checking the loaf after 1 hour, then every 30 minutes, and then more frequently as it nears finishing. Record this baking time for future reference. Bread is done with an internal temperature of 190°F to 200°F: Checking the internal temperature of the loaf is the best way to tell when it is done baking; a finished loaf will have an internal temperature of 190°F to 200°F. The top will also feel soft but no longer spongy, and the bottom will be hard and slightly golden. Brown the loaf under the broiler: If a darker-colored, crustier loaf is desired, set the loaf on a rack positioned in the middle of the oven and turn on the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Check frequently to avoid burning the loaf. Cool and slice: Let the loaf cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. submitted by Kitchn - much more here!';

Adjust the heat so they dont burn and add more oil, as needed. Transfer cooked latkes to a paper-towel-lined tray. You can keep them warm in a 225ºF oven until ready to serve. submitted by Lisa G.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easier cleanup, if desired. Pull the leaves off of the cauliflower base. Cut off the lower part of the stem. Cut the head of cauliflower into four quarters. Slice each quarter into 6-8 pieces. You want as many flat surfaces as possible on each floret-- the flat surfaces caramelize best. Caramelization is the key to giving the roasted cauliflower flavor. Give all the florets a thorough rinse in a colander. Shake them dry. Spread out the cauliflower on your baking sheet or pan. Reserve any small bits of cauliflower that have fallen away from the florets in a small bowl. Drizzle the florets evenly with 1 tbsp olive oil. I use a measuring spoon of olive oil, which makes it easier to gauge how much oil Im using, rather than pouring straight from the bottle. Toss the florets to coat them fully with oil-- I use clean hands for this step. Sprinkle the cauliflower evenly with smoked paprika and salt to taste. Be generous with the salt-- smoked paprika really sings when its combined with salt. Place the baking sheet into the preheated oven and let the cauliflower roast for 10 minutes. While cauliflower is cooking, drizzle 1/4 tsp of olive oil into the small bowl of reserved cauliflower bits that have fallen away from the florets and toss to coat. Sprinkle them with smoked paprika and salt. You will add these to the sheet a little later so they wont burn. After 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the reserved cauliflower bits onto the baking sheet. Return the baking sheet to the oven. Let the cauliflower roast for 10-20 minutes longer till tender.

When you are ready to make the sandwiches, have the buns ready (I like to lightly toast them) and the lettuce and tomato cut into sandwich-ready slices. Heat a heavy skillet over medium high heat, and add enough oil to the skillet to coat the bottom well (2-3 Tbsp). While the skillet heats, season your chicken breasts well on both sides with salt and pepper. Dunk the chicken breasts first in the egg, and then dredge them in the flour, shaking any excess off. Fry the chicken breasts in the oil until they are golden brown on both sides and cooked through, 3-4 minutes per side. While the chicken cooks, melt the butter in a saucepan and add the hot sauce. Whisk well until it is combined, then take off the heat. When the chicken breasts are cooked through, remove them from the heat. Pour the hot sauce/butter mixture into a medium sized mixing bowl, and, working one at a time, place the still-hot breasts into the sauce, tossing them to coat.

REPLACE INTO `Directions` SET `ID`='3303', `RecipeID`='3303', `SortOrder`='0', `Directions`='started off by cooking up a batch of ramen noodles according to the directions on the package. Once they were done I drained out the remaining water, let them cool and then mixed an egg in with them. I then dumped the noodles onto a cutting board and spread them out until the pile was about a half of an inch thick all the way around. After that I cut two bread-sized square pieces of ramen out of the pile using a knife and placed each one between two pieces of wax paper and put them in my refrigerator. About 20 minutes later my newly created ramen noodle “bread slices” were holding together quite nicely so I took them out of the refrigerator and threw them into a pan on my stove where I heated them both up for a few minutes each on one side. Then, I flipped one of them over, added a couple slices of cheese, added the second one on top of it and just finished frying them like you would with a regular grilled cheese sandwich. When my Ramen Grilled Cheese was finished the noodles ended up nice and crispy on the outside, yet still soft and noodle-like on the inside. In a way ramen works almost better than bread in a grilled cheese because when the cheese melts it sort of fills in all the little nooks and crannies between the noodles. much more at http://dudefoods.com/the-ramen-noodle-grilled-cheese-sandwich/';

Lightly spray or rub the parchment paper with some vegetable oil or a Pam spray. Place your potato slices on the parchment paper, then sprinkle them with whatever you like and then place another piece of parchment paper on top.
