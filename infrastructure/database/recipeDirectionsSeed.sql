Tiny scallops just arent very exciting. *Ground chili paste can usually be found in your markets Asian products aisle (I used one called Sambal Oelek).

I remove ours at 18 minutes and its a great balance of chewy crunch. If you like your bacon crispy enough to crumble, you will probably want to cook it another minute past that. COOK THE POTATOES: While the bacon is cooking, peel and chop the potatoes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate to drain. There should be 2-3 tablespoons of bacon grease left on the tray. (If there is more than that, drain off a bit.) Put the potatoes on the tray and toss with tongs to thoroughly coat them in the bacon grease. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes out in a single layer and bake for 20 minutes, stir well and bake an additional 20 minutes. Stir again, making sure that none of the potatoes are sticking to the tray. Bake another 15 minutes. Chop the bacon into small pieces. Remove the potatoes from the oven, stir again and sprinkle generously with shredded cheese and chopped bacon.

Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add applesauce and vanilla and mix till combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift the dry ingredients together. Add the dry ingredients to the batter in three parts alternating with the yogurt in two parts, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Beat until just combined. Spoon half of the batter into the prepared pan. Spoon the cooled apple mixture over the batter carefully and spread as evenly as possible. Sprinkle 2/3 of brown sugar cinnamon mixture over apples and cover with the rest of the batter. Sprinkle the rest of the brown sugar cinnamon mixture over the top. Bake for 45-55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. For Glaze: While the cake is baking, make the glaze. In a bowl, mix the powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk until the glaze is desired consistency. When the cake comes out of the oven, immediately but carefully pour onto hot cake. Try to pour as evenly as possible. You might have to pick up the cake and tilt it to spread the glaze evenly. I even poured some out that pooled at the corners and repoured that over the top. Let the cake sit for awhile for the glaze to set. From LeClubCooking - more here!';

If you choose to use the microwave, take the bowl out every 30 seconds and give it a gentle stir. Doing so, there are less chances youâll burn the chocolate. While the chocolate is melting, in a mixing bowl, beat together 2 eggs, sugar, and vanilla until pale and creamy, for about 5 minutes at medium speed. The mixture thickens up and become slightly frothy. Stir the melted chocolate into the egg mixture and gently stir in the flour and baking powder.

Then, over medium-low heat, whisk in the chocolate. The result is a homogenous sauce. Put the saucepan in a bowl partly filled with ice cubes (or pour into another bowl over the ice -- it will chill faster), then whisk the chocolate sauce, either manually with a whisk or with an electric mixer (if using an electric mixer, watch closely -- it will thicken faster). Whisking creates large air bubbles in the sauce, which steadily thickens. After a while strands of chocolate form inside the loops of the whisk. Pour or spoon immediately into ramekins, small bowls or jars and let set. Note: Three things can go wrong. Heres how to fix them. If your chocolate doesnt contain enough fat, melt the mixture again, add some chocolate, and then whisk it again. If the mousse is not light enough, melt the mixture again, add some water, and whisk it once more. If you whisk it too much, so that it becomes grainy, this means that the foam has turned into an emulsion. In that case simply melt the mixture and whisk it again, adding nothing. Serve immediately, or refrigerate. Top with whipped cream if desired You can get different textures depending on when you stop whisking: 1) For a mod, flat-topped look, like sexy pot de creme: pour it into ramekins while its thickened, but still a bit warm. 2) When it gets to the texture of thick pudding, you can spoon it into a glass parfait-style, like little chocolate snowdrifts (as in our photos). At this stage, our Assistant Editor Nozlee Samadzadeh has also used it to frost a cake. 3) Whip it just a bit further for something fluffy you can ball up in an ice cream scoop, if thats what youre going for.

REPLACE INTO `Directions` SET `ID`='977', `RecipeID`='977', `SortOrder`='0', `Directions`='1. Prepare the cheesecake layer: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place a large roasting pan on the lower third rack of the oven. Place a kettle of water on the stove to boil. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. Wrap a double layer of foil around the bottom and up the sides of the pan (you want to seal it so the water from the water bath doesnt seep into the pan). In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to mix the cream cheese- blend until it is nice and smooth and creamy. Mix in sugar and salt and blend for 2 minutes, scraping down sides of the bowl as needed. Add eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition. Finally, mix in sour cream, whipping cream and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the pan into the roasting pan in the pre-heated oven. Carefully pour the hot water from your kettle into the roasting pan (it will fill the pan surrounding the cheesecake). Pour enough water so that there is about an inch of water coming up the foil along the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake the cheesecake for 45 minutes. It should be set to the touch and not jiggly. Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour. When it has cooled, place the pan into the freezer and let the cheesecake freeze completely. This can be done in several hours- or overnight. 2. Prepare the cake layers: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round metal baking pans (or spray with nonstick baking spray with flour). In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Add eggs, oil, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and vinegar to the flour mixture. Using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat for 1 minute, until blended. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans, dividing equally. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Let cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pans, then invert cakes onto a rack to cool completely. 3. Prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter and vanilla until it is smooth and creamy (do not overbeat). 4. Assemble the cake: Place one cake layer into the center of a cake plate or platter. Remove the cheesecake from the freezer, take off the sides of the pan, and slide a knife under the parchment to remove the cheesecake from the pan. Peel off the parchment. Measure your cheesecake layer against the cake layers. If the cheesecake layer turns out to be a slightly larger round than your cake, move it to a cutting board and gently shave off some of the exterior of the cheesecake to get it to the same size as your cake layers. Place the cheesecake layer on top of the first cake layer. Place the 2nd cake layer on top of the cheesecake. 5. Frost the cake: Apply a crumb coat layer to the cake- use a long, thin spatula to cover the cake completely with a thin and even layer of frosting. Be sure to wipe off your spatula each time you are about to dip it back into the bowl to get more frosting (this way you wont be transferring any red crumbs into the bowl of frosting). dont worry at this point about the crumbs being visible in the frosting on the cake. When your cake has a thin layer of frosting all over it, place it into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set the frosting. Once the first layer of frosting is set, apply the 2nd layer. Start by adding a large scoop of frosting onto the top of the cake. Use a long, thin spatula to spread the frosting evenly across the top and then spread it down the sides of the cake too. Because you applied a crumb-coat layer, you shouldnt have any red crumbs floating around in the final frosting layer. Decorate, as desired. I recommend white chocolate shavings (see *Tips below). Keep this cake refrigerated. Tips: *For making white chocolate shavings: Purchase a hunk of white chocolate. Microwave the chocolate to soften it up slightly (15 to 30 seconds, depending on the size). Use a potato peeler to run down the side of the chocolate to create shards/shaves/curls of white chocolate. I like to shave it onto a paper plater and then just use the plate to slide the chocolate onto the top of the cake. *If you are serving this cake at a party, its perfectly okay to leave the cake at room temperature for an hour or so while serving. Otherwise, keep it in the refrigerator. It also freezes perfectly! I made my cake one day and then just placed it as-is in the freezer and pulled it out the next day. It thaws quickly. more at recipegirl.com';

Spray foil lightly with cooking spray. In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Return the mixture to the heat briefly, just till its hot, but not bubbling; itll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heat the butter and sugar a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Stir in the cocoa, salt, baking powder and vanilla, Add the eggs, beating till smooth: then add the flour and chocolate chips, beating will well combined. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Bake the brownies for 28 to 30 minutes, (this took more like 35 minutes for me) until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out dry (though it may have a few crumbs clinging to it). The brownies should feel set both on the edges, and in the center. Remove them from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges with a table knife; this helps prevent the brownies from sinking in the center as they cool. When brownies have cooled, lift them out of the pan by grabbing on to both ends of the foil. Lay foiled brownies on a flat surface. With a biscuit cutter or deep cookie cutter, cut out rounds of brownie and place on a cooling rack that has been placed over a sheet of wax paper. In double boiler, melt about 18 ounces of chocolate chips plus a tablespoon or so of shortening until smooth. Drop a tablespoon of the melted chocolate on top of each mini-brownie and allow it to flow over the sides. Smooth sides with a knife. Set aside to cool. I put mine in the freezer for a few minutes.

Ill use the majority of one bunch, then save the rest for the other mexican dishes Im cooking. Add lemon/lime juice. Suggested is 1 TBSP. Always to taste, but is needed for yumminess. If you have the fake lemon or lime container in the fridge, squirt it around the bowl for 2-4 passes. If you have fresh fruit, roll the lemon/lime on the table while pushing down with your palm. This will help release the juice from the fruit. Cut in half and squeeze onto the salsa, without dropping the seeds in. Ill use one fresh lemon and one fresh lime. Stir. Refridgerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Serve with your favorite chips. I use Tortilla Multigrain. Enjoy!!';

If you make them yourself, I donât think you will ever go back to purchasing taco shells. All you need is some tortillas and cooking spray. We used some small, soft âtacoâ tortillas. We used the flour kind but corn is fine too. First you want to steam themâ¦ Wet some paper towels and wring them out well. Layer the tortillas with the wet paper towels on a plate and then microwave (we did 6 at a time). Keep an eye on them, it should be about 30 seconds until they are steamed. Then lightly spray each side with cooking spray and drape each tortilla over two bars of the oven rack. It is wise to put a baking sheet below them to catch any oil from the cooking spray. Bake at 350-375 degrees for 7-10 minutes. You will be able to tell that they are browning & getting crispy. Take them out and set them aside! Okay, now for the filling All you need is ground beef (2 pounds), 1 can of refried beans, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 packet of taco seasoning, shredded cheese, & your favorite taco toppings. Brown the ground beef in a large skillet. COMPLETELY drain all grease and return to skillet. Over low heat, add refried beans, taco seasoning, and about half to two-thirds of the tomato sauce (you can eye this to see whats best, you donât want the filling to be too runny or your tacos will be soggy on the bottoms).

It takes a little while for it to reduce and develop flavor. Heat a large saucepan under medium high heat and melt the butter. Add the carrot, celery, onion, and country ham. Do not skip the country ham. I think it really gives the sauce a depth of flavor that you donât get with just plain mirepoix. However, do watch your salt â since the ham is cured, itâs pretty salty to begin with, so you may not even have to season with any additional (I didnât). Cook the vegetables until they are starting to become tender and the onions are translucent. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Cook roux for about 10 minutes, or until it begins a nice nutty brown color. Slowly stir in your beef stock, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Add tomato paste, parsley stems, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Leave partially covered and simmer for at least an hour to develop flavors. Skim off any fat or scum as you see fit. When the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, strain the liquid of the solids. Season to taste and keep warm until ready to use. While your sauce is simmering, you can caramelize your onions and cook your bacon. Melt the butter in a large saute pan under medium heat. Add onions and cook under low to medium heat until caramelized and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Donât rush the onions, the slower they cook, the sweeter and tastier theyâll be. You donât want any browning, so be sure to stir them every so often. Place onions in a medium bowl to cool. Heat a small skillet under medium heat and add your strips of bacon. Cook until crisp, then remove with a slotted spoon, transferring to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. When bacon is dry, add in with onions. Reserve about 3 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat from the pan. Add shredded cheese to bowl with onions and bacon and mix well. Taste for seasoning. Place the flank steak horizontally in front of you (so that it is widest). Spread the mustard atop the steak. Place an even layer of the filling over top of the mustard. Roll the steak up, like a jelly roll, keeping it as tight as possible. Cut in half and tie each roulade like a roast with some kitchen twine. Season the roulade with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 425 F. Heat a large oven-proof skillet under medium high heat and add reserved bacon fat. Add the roulades and cook until all sides are golden brown and caramelized. Transfer the pan to the even to finish cooking, about 15-20 minutes, depending on your desired doneness. Let roulades rest for at least 5 minutes before removing kitchen twine and slicing. Remove kitchen twine with kitchen scissors and cut roulades into 1/2 inch slices. Serve atop sauce brune and with desired vegetable or starch.';

Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and allow it to warm slightly as you prepare the butter herb mix (5 minutes or so). In a small bowl, stir together the butter, minced garlic, basil, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Rosemary pieces can be quite large, so either chop or crumble the dried pieces with your hands before adding them to the mix. Place the chicken on a cutting board and pat it dry on both sides with a clean paper towel. Smear the butter herb mixture over both sides of the chicken. Drying the meat will help the butter herb mixture stick. If the meat is too cold, it will form condensation as you rub the butter mixture over the surface and the butter will not stick. Place the seasoned chicken pieces in a casserole dish that is deep enough to fully contain the chicken. Cover tightly with foil, or with the dishs lid if there is one. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, basting once half way through. Ater 90 minutes, remove the foil, baste again, and adjust the ovens temperature to 425ÂºF.

REPLACE INTO `Directions` SET `ID`='2070', `RecipeID`='2070', `SortOrder`='0', `Directions`='1 To kick off the construction of this pork medley youll need to create a 5x5 bacon weave. If the strips youre using arent wide enough to span 5x5 inches, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern. Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with. 2 The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave. (BBQ Addict recommends Bad Byrons Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlens All-Purpose Rub). 3 Now that youre pork is well seasoned, its time to add more pork. Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave. Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across. Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like. 4 Next up is bacon layer number two. Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast. If you like soft bacon, make it soft. If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy. 5 Since this is a barbecue recipe, we need to add another layer of barbecue flavor. Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces. (BBQ Addict recommends Burnt Finger BBQs homemade competition sauce). Once youve sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbecue seasoning you used on the bacon weave. 6 Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards. You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll. Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed. Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside. 7 At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but were missing one key item. To complete the construction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave. Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up. 8 Sprinkle some barbecue seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now it is ready for the smoker. Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225Â°F in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your meat thermometer gives an internal temperature reading of 165Â°F Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek. BBQ Addict recommends 2.5 hours, for a roll 2.5 inches in diameter. 9 Now that the Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, you need to add some finishing flavors. Remember that barbecue sauce you used for inner flavor? youll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave. Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce. Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so theyll give your fatty a nice glossy finish. Spicy and vinegar based sauces dont contain as much, so they wont set up as well. If youre dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and youll get the same effect. 10 Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve. If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.';

Let the shrimp marinate for 30-60 minutes, flipping the bag around once or twice during that time, so that all the shrimp stay evenly covered in the marinade. 3.) When youre ready to cook, take the shrimp out of the fridge and let them sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; there is no need to add any oil or butter to the pan, as the marinade has enough oil in it to keep the shrimp from sticking to the pan. (If you would prefer to use the grill for these, you can thread them onto skewers and toss them on the grill at this point.) 4.) Add your shrimp to the pan in a single layer, making sure they are not too crowded; you can always cook them in more than one batch. Let them cook on one side for about a minute, until they curl up and start to turn pink. Flip them over, and cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the shrimp are opaque. Remove from the pan, and serve immediately! more at thedoughwillriseagain.wordpress.com';

You can either skewer the shrimp, or place them directly on the grill. Personally, I skewer them. its way too much work flipping the shrimp individually, and youre bound to get a few burned that way. Shrimp cook quickly, so youâre going to want to take them off as soon as they lose their translucent appearance and turn pinkish. This should take about 5 or 6 minutes per side on a medium hot grill. I typically turn them often to keep from burning them. much more at http://www.smokedngrilled.com/lemon-spice-grilled-shrimp/';

Dredge the chicken in flour one more time, then place the chicken on a plate, and repeat with all chicken pieces. So its easy, flour, buttermilk, flour. If your flour gets too dirty just throw it out and start with fresh flour. In a frying pan, heat lots of oil, at least an inch. Make sure the oil is hot enough. Do not put too many pieces at once, leave enough room in between the chicken, because you dont want them to stick together. Also if you put too many chicken pieces, the chicken might not cook all the way through. The first side will take longer to cook maybe about 7 min, and the second side will cook faster, 3 to 5 minutes, so be patient and let the chicken cook properly. Repeat with remaining chicken.

Toss well and press the chicken pieces into the flour dredge with your palms to get good contact with the meat. Let stand for ten minutes, then toss again and press down with your palms again. This ensures a good crust on the chicken. Now its time to warm up your oil and butter. In a 12 inch cast iron skillet heat 1 inch canola or corn oil with Â½ cup real dairy butter until it reaches 35O degrees F. Just below medium heat works well on my stove but use a thermometer to be sure. A cast iron skillet is the best for fried chicken. Be extra careful to regulate the heat properly of using anything other than cast iron. Even cooking is essential. Drop the dredged chicken pieces into the hot oil/butter mix and cook for approximately 35- 40 minutes depending on the size of your chicken pieces, turning at least once halfway through the cooking time. I start with the dark meat pieces and add the breasts about 10-15 minutes into the cooking time because these will cook faster. I always use my meat thermometer to ensure that the largest pieces have reached an internal temperature of 175 degrees F, which is perfect for fried chicken. The chicken should be a beautiful golden brown when it comes out of the oil. Let it rest on a wire rack to drain for 10 minutes before serving.';

Stir to incorporate and continue stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens (about 2 minutes). 4. Remove from heat and taste-test. You should taste sweet first, followed by sour, then spicy and salty notes. If the sauce isnt sweet enough, add a little more sugar. If not spicy enough, add more chili. 5.

The onions should start to brown, but without burning (a couple of onions may be burnt here and there, but overall they should not be charred). Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking onions for 10 more minutes, continuing to stir, as onions brown even more without burning. At this point add just a pinch of salt over onions. Continue cooking for 10 more minutes on medium or low heat, stirring occasionally to make sure onions donât stick to the bottom of the pan or burn. Total you should have cooked onions for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle onions with a small amount of balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan. Using spatula, mix the onions, scraping the bottom of the pan and coating onions with a pinch of balsamic vinegar you just added. 2) While youâre caramelizing the onions, cook bacon: I usually bake it in the oven at 350 until it just turns crispy. Drain the bacon on paper towels and chop into small pieces. 3) Cook elbow macaroni according to package instructions. Rinse the macaroni under cold running water, drain. Set aside. 4) In a large saucepan, add heavy cream, milk, sharp white cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese and 1/4 teaspoon salt on medium heat, stir and mix, until cheeses start to blend. Add black pepper, Cayenne pepper and paprika to your taste, or omit them if you donât want them. Add elbow macaroni to the creamy sauce, stir to coat on low heat for about 5-10 minutes until cheeses melt completely and coat the macaroni. 6) Add caramelized onions and chopped bacon to the creamy macaroni. 7) Serve on warm plates (warmed in the oven) as is, or with more cheese (finely grated) sprinkled on top. much more at http://juliasalbum.com/macaroni-and-cheese-with-bacon-and-caramelized-onions-recipe/';

Add the onion and sautÃ© for about 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add the ground beef to the pan and season with salt and pepper.

Using a roll pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas). Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes. While the dough is rising again, melt 3 tablespoons of butter. Mix it with the garlic and 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese. Bring the dough back out and using a spoon or pastry brush, douse the outside edges with the butter and garlic mixture. You can spread the butter all over, just make sure to focus on the edges. Use it all up! Continue to make your pizza with your desired toppings. Bake the pizza for 23-25 minutes (or longer if needed, depending on your toppings), or until crust and cheese are both golden. While pizza is baking, melt remaining butter and combine with the last tablespoon of parmesan. Remove pizza from over and immediately brush the outside edges with parmesan butter, using it all up. Sprinkle a bit of parmesan over top if desired. Serve! Note: I realize that if you buy yeast in the packets, it can be a pain to measure 3 teaspoons. If you dont want to do that, I suggest making a double recipe of this crust. However! I also prefer buying jars of yeast these days instead of packets, and just keeping it in the fridge, so I suggest doing that. more at howsweeteats.com';

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes or until dough is smooth. Add a little more flour if it is too sticky. Shape the dough into a sausage shape about 40cm long. Divide the dough in half and half again and so on until you have 16 pieces roughly the same size. Roll each piece into a ball and then flatten it out with the palm of your hand. Cover the dough pieces with a clean tea towel and allow them to rest for 15 minutes. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Working on one at a time, roll out each dough piece on a lightly floured surface. Try to get them nice and thin. Place the dough circle into the not frying pan and cook for 1 minute or until a few golden brown spots appear on the underside. Some bubbles will also start to form on top. Flip the tortilla over and cook for another 30 seconds. If the tortillas are browning too fast, turn the heat down a little. Remove the tortilla from the pan and place in a large zip loc bag or covered container. This will keep them flexible and warm. Repeat steps 9 to 12 with the remaining dough circles.

Set the shaped dough on a square of parchment paper. (If youre baking the bread in a pan, theres no need to use parchment.) Lift it into the slow cooker: Lift the loaf by the parchment and set it in the middle of the slow cooker. Try to arrange flatten the parchment as much as possible against the sides of the slow cooker to prevent it from getting caught in the bread as it rises. Cover the slow cooker with its lid. â Pre-Baking Rise?You do not need to let your bread rise before baking. However, if your bread dough has been in the refrigerator, letting it warm a bit on the counter can reduce the overall cooking time. Set the slow cooker to HIGH: Turn on your slow cooker to the highest heat setting (or quickest time setting). Bake for 1 to 2 1/2 hours: Baking time will vary depending on your slow cooker. If this is your first time baking bread in your slow cooker, begin checking the loaf after 1 hour, then every 30 minutes, and then more frequently as it nears finishing. Record this baking time for future reference. Bread is done with an internal temperature of 190Â°F to 200Â°F: Checking the internal temperature of the loaf is the best way to tell when it is done baking; a finished loaf will have an internal temperature of 190Â°F to 200Â°F. The top will also feel soft but no longer spongy, and the bottom will be hard and slightly golden. Brown the loaf under the broiler: If a darker-colored, crustier loaf is desired, set the loaf on a rack positioned in the middle of the oven and turn on the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Check frequently to avoid burning the loaf. Cool and slice: Let the loaf cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. submitted by Kitchn - much more here!';

Melt one stick of butter in the microwave (Yes... one whole stick lol) stir the melted butter and seasonings together until blended. Add the quartered rolls to the butter, and toss gently to coat. Bread dough is sticky, so, you may need to use your hands to gently pull the pieces apart if necessary. You dont want the dough to form clumps, or it will effect how it bakes. This is really the only way to mess-up this recipe....very important! Next, add 2/3 cup of grated Parmesan-Romano cheese reserving the rest for the top. Toss until each piece is coated. You can bake this bread in any shape you like, but, today, I chose a loaf pan. Layer the dough quarters evenly in a standard 9x3x2 inch loaf pan sprayed with cooking spray. The dough pieces naturally stick together due to the butter and cheese, but, gently pull apart any clumps of dough. We want to be certain the bread bakes evenly. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese on top and a sprinkle of parsley for color. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with cooking spray. This will keep the bread from sticking to the plastic wrap as it rises. Allow to rise in a draft free, warm place for 2-2 1/2 hours. Then, remove the plastic wrap, and place into a 350Â°F preheated oven. Bake at 350Â°F for 18 minutes, then check the top. If baking in a loaf, you may need to lay a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the bread to prevent the cheese and butter on top from over browning while the inside of the loaf fully bakes.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easier cleanup, if desired. Pull the leaves off of the cauliflower base. Cut off the lower part of the stem. Cut the head of cauliflower into four quarters. Slice each quarter into 6-8 pieces. You want as many flat surfaces as possible on each floret-- the flat surfaces caramelize best. Caramelization is the key to giving the roasted cauliflower flavor. Give all the florets a thorough rinse in a colander. Shake them dry. Spread out the cauliflower on your baking sheet or pan. Reserve any small bits of cauliflower that have fallen away from the florets in a small bowl. Drizzle the florets evenly with 1 tbsp olive oil. I use a measuring spoon of olive oil, which makes it easier to gauge how much oil Im using, rather than pouring straight from the bottle. Toss the florets to coat them fully with oil-- I use clean hands for this step. Sprinkle the cauliflower evenly with smoked paprika and salt to taste. Be generous with the salt-- smoked paprika really sings when its combined with salt. Place the baking sheet into the preheated oven and let the cauliflower roast for 10 minutes. While cauliflower is cooking, drizzle 1/4 tsp of olive oil into the small bowl of reserved cauliflower bits that have fallen away from the florets and toss to coat. Sprinkle them with smoked paprika and salt. You will add these to the sheet a little later so they wont burn. After 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the reserved cauliflower bits onto the baking sheet. Return the baking sheet to the oven. Let the cauliflower roast for 10-20 minutes longer till tender. When its ready you will be able to pierce it easily with a fork.

When you are ready to make the sandwiches, have the buns ready (I like to lightly toast them) and the lettuce and tomato cut into sandwich-ready slices. Heat a heavy skillet over medium high heat, and add enough oil to the skillet to coat the bottom well (2-3 Tbsp). While the skillet heats, season your chicken breasts well on both sides with salt and pepper. Dunk the chicken breasts first in the egg, and then dredge them in the flour, shaking any excess off. Fry the chicken breasts in the oil until they are golden brown on both sides and cooked through, 3-4 minutes per side. While the chicken cooks, melt the butter in a saucepan and add the hot sauce. Whisk well until it is combined, then take off the heat. When the chicken breasts are cooked through, remove them from the heat. Pour the hot sauce/butter mixture into a medium sized mixing bowl, and, working one at a time, place the still-hot breasts into the sauce, tossing them to coat.

Notes: They make round tortilla warmers like foam coolers that are usually less than$3, but any covered dish will do. You may need more flour than usual on your surface because these tortillas are slightly more soft which makes them easier to roll but also sticky if you dont use enough flour. I place a paper towel or cloth in the bottom of the warmer before I start adding the tortillas to prevent the bottom one from getting soggy from steam. If you like the fluffy tortillas like on a muchaco or gordita (sp?) at chain resturaunts you can add baking powder to this and make circles slightly smaller.

Once they were done I drained out the remaining water, let them cool and then mixed an egg in with them. I then dumped the noodles onto a cutting board and spread them out until the pile was about a half of an inch thick all the way around. After that I cut two bread-sized square pieces of ramen out of the pile using a knife and placed each one between two pieces of wax paper and put them in my refrigerator. About 20 minutes later my newly created ramen noodle âbread slicesâ were holding together quite nicely so I took them out of the refrigerator and threw them into a pan on my stove where I heated them both up for a few minutes each on one side. Then, I flipped one of them over, added a couple slices of cheese, added the second one on top of it and just finished frying them like you would with a regular grilled cheese sandwich. When my Ramen Grilled Cheese was finished the noodles ended up nice and crispy on the outside, yet still soft and noodle-like on the inside. In a way ramen works almost better than bread in a grilled cheese because when the cheese melts it sort of fills in all the little nooks and crannies between the noodles. much more at http://dudefoods.com/the-ramen-noodle-grilled-cheese-sandwich/';
