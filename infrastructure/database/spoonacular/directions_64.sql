('7212', '1', 'Follow the package directions to make 2 C of cooked buckwheat. For perfect hard boiled eggs, just add 2 eggs to a pot of cold water. Bring the water to a boil, cover then take them off the heat for 8 minutes.'),

Cook for about a minute or until the leaves have wilted (the rib running down the middle will still be hard).'),
('7212', '4', 'Transfer to a bowl of cold water then gently squeeze the excess water out of the leaves.Lay a lettuce leaf on a prep surface and gently unfold the leafy part (see first photo below). Using a sharp knife, cut about 1/3 of the center rib out as shown in the photo below.'),

Fold other side of the leaf in the same way then roll the leaf using your fingers to hold the stuffing in.To serve, just top with the yogurt sauce and chopped pine nuts. If you''re taking them on a picnic it will probably be easier to dip the rolls in the sauce like a spring roll.'),
