Softer, greener, garlicky flavor. Nice.And the greens. I got these from the Thai family that sells at the market. I have no idea what they are. The only explanation I got was, "We cook it with fish. There is no English word for them." Sold. Oh, they were good with fish, too. You can substitute baby bok choy or spinach.

Did mine eat this? Definitely, and once her serving was finished, she ate most of mine for seconds. You just never know if you don''t try.Even if sometimes you don''t want to. Like the evening my spouse and I treated ourselves to a pound of wild caught salmon he smoked on the grill. The kiddo eyed her pork and noodles, pushed it away, and said, "I want THAT!" pointing at our $30-a-pound-once-a-year luxury.We looked at each other. Should we? I forked over a couple bites."I like it!" Kiddo exclaims. Of course she does. Good food really doesn''t have an age limit any more than someone telling me I''m too old for an ice cream cone.A couple tips on giving fish to your child, however, make sure it is one of the more sustainable choices for the environment, and for things like mercury contamination level.
