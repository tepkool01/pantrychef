So heat your grill to high.7If you have a fish basket, now is the time to break it out. Otherwise, make sure you REALLY clean and oil the grates of your grill with some vegetable oil. Nothing sticks quicker than fish and it''s really kind of heartbreaking when you leave some of that delicious meat back on the grates.8'),

These times are optional, but it is pretty easy to see when fish is done cooking. As the fish cooks through, the meat becomes more and more opaque. Remember though, don''t overdue it!10'),
