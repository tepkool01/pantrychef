('3417', '1', 'If you have leftovers of this Grilled Halibut with Cumin and Lime, use it to make fish tacos!(For Phase One Fridays I highlight Phase One recipes from the past that have been my personal favorites. This delicious recipe for grilled halibut is something I made regularly back in the days I was organizing houseboat trips, and it''s still one of my favorite marinades for grilled fish.)Imagine you''re sitting on the top deck of a houseboat looking out at the beautiful scenery of Utah''s gorgeous Lake Powell while you''re eating a wonderful dinner featuring this Grilled Halibut with Cumin and Lime. That''s the memory I had when I sat on my deck eating this a few days ago. The marinade is perfect for halibut, but you can use any kind of mild white fish that''s firm enough to stay together on the grill. And the leftover fish is perfect for making fish tacos (if you have any leftovers!)I do want to say just a bit about marinating fish before you grill it. Often meats are marinated to tenderize, but when you''re marinating fish it''s just to add flavor, so don''t marinate the fish too long. That''s especially important with a marinade that has lime or lemon juice because the marinade will start to "cook" the fish. Because they''re used for short marinating times, fish marinades are often stronger than those designed for beef, pork, or chicken, but you can reduce the spices in this a little if it seems like too much for you. I''m a huge fan of cumin, so I used the whole 2 teaspoons of cumin, and really loved that flavor.Zest the skin of one small lime. You can use a fine cheese grater to do this if you don''t have a microplane grater like this, but this is one of my favorite kitchen tools.'),

If you want nice diagonal marks, lay the fish at an angle to the grill grates. (I can''t seem to quite get the white balance right on these grill shots taken under the covered part of my deck. Photographers, feel free to chime in with suggestions!)Then as soon as you see grill marks have formed (I lift up the edge and check) rotate the fish so it''s going the opposite way. For a nice hot grill, the grill marks take about 3 minutes each way, for a total of 6 minutes cooking on the first side.Then turn the fish over carefully and cook on the second side until the fish feels firm (but not hard) to the touch.

Oil the grill grates (I use a paper towel with some oil poured on.) Preheat grill to medium hot.
