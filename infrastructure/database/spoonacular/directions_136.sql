('21155', '1', 'New Curries is one of the latest in the series of Women''s Weekly Cookbooks. It certainly seems that there is probably at least one of these cookbooks in every household here in Australia. We''ve all turned to their pages for reliable recipes that work.Don''t let the length of the ingredient list dissuade you from trying this curry. Once you have the ingredients organised the process is actually pretty simple and the dish is ready in 30 minutes.My only complaint is in the photograph used to accompany this dish. There''s no way that the dish pictured could have been produced by following the recipe. I''m used to that being the case with Donna Hay but it''s disappointing to see that the ever reliable AWW has succumbed to styling versus substance.Kenyan Chicken Curry['),

('21163', '1', 'The point of a stew, it should go without saying, is its flavour rather than its form. So while the crunchy salad strips of carrot, scallion and bell pepper, do bring colour and beauty to the otherwise brown study, their texture and Asian-flavoured bite provide the perfect partner for the rich aromatic spiciness of the soft-braised stew beneath.'),
('21163', '2', 'Cooking the shin on the bone gives me a certain primitive pleasure, and the meat even more melting tenderness, but you can buy cubed beef shank off the bone (or other stew meat, if you must), in which case, you won''t need as much in weight.'),

('21163', '10', 'For the salad: Peel the carrots, cut into long slices, and then julienne them (i.e. cut into matchstick-like strips). Trim and halve the scallions and then julienne as well. Seed the chillies and also cut into juliennes, and finely chop the cilantro.'),
