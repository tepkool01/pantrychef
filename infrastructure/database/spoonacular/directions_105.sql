You see, growing up, my family traveled to Calistoga, just north of the city of Napa, to visit the mud - and the mineral springs pools. OK, we mostly visited the mineral pools, but the mud part is more fun to discuss. A mud bath will change the way you look at...mud. And life. Anyways, so, when I think of Napa, I think of produce, wine, Farmer''s Markets and, yes, mud.   Farmer''s Markets. I had seen beautiful Farmer''s Markets in Northern California,  but the Napa markets have a unique elegant style. Since we were on vacation, we basically strolled through the markets quickly, but I do remember a flurry of culinary aromas and colors hitting my senses all at once...There colors: bright green bell peppers, shiny purple eggplant, rouge-colored berries, fluffy brim-filled bins of fresh baby greens, spiky green artichokes and cheerful green peas. The rain-fresh air allowed for the market aromas to sharpen and tone on the tip of my nose: fresh pungent garlic piled in a heap of white, gray and purple. Spicy spring onions. Sweet golden apples - leaves still attached. Grassy-smelling plump red tomatoes. Lemons, radishes and dark purple kale. There was even fresh baked bread peeking out from crisp white paper bags, resting in a straw basket.It''s not surprising that Napa draws some of the world''s greatest chefs and foodies.'),
