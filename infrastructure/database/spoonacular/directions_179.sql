I''m a bit embarrassed to admit that I used to beg my mom to buy those individual chicken pot pies from the freezer section at the store. I loved them. Until one day in junior high school when I actually read the label and it said something like 1200 calorie and 70 grams of fat per pie.  I freaked out and swore off ever eating a pot pie again. Until I tried Amy''s Kitchen Dairy-Free pot pie. I fell back in love with them. Amy''s dairy-free version is made with tofu and it''s vegan-and delicious. Flaky crust. Creamy filling. Thick tofu cubes. Yum. But still frozen. I wanted a fresh pie! Then one day on the Food Network I saw Paula Deen whipping up a quickie version of a pot pie for an ''easy dinners'' episode of her show. Easy? I thought wow,  it does look kinda easy. So I decided to give it a try using all vegan ingredients.Pot Pie Ingredients. Must have ingredients for a homestyle pot pie include carrots, peas, mushrooms and some sort of onion. I used scallions. I also had to include a bay leaf or two and a lot of cumin and black pepper. I also added some lemon juice, maple syrup and parsley to the flavor mix. I was using tofu in place of the traditional chicken protein. And as always, I cooked and flavored all the ingredients before adding them into the pie filling mix. I did a double layer crust-top and bottom. And side note, I actually found this almost too crusty. You could easily get away with only doing a top crust and getting more of that yummy filling in the pan. Your choice.
