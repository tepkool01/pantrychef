('5882', '1', 'Hey Divas, today I''m bringing you another installment in my "Simple Suppers" series! These are meals that can be cooked up quickly after a long day at work. They require minimal cooking time and typically can be made using one pot. They''re also healthy, featuring my signature combination of protein, fresh vegetables and whole grains. To view all of my Simple Suppers, CLICK HERE!Today''s recipe is a delicious Curried Shrimp dish that can be made in one pot! I got the inspiration for this dish at the Studio City Farmers Market on Sunday, where I found a great fish vendor with fresh shrimp for sale. I also scooped up the organic bell pepper, organic cilantro and organic yellow cherry tomatoes used in this recipe! I combined these ingredients with some other great flavors, and served the resulting dish over an organic long grain brown rice. It was so delicious, that I plan to keep this recipe in my regular rotation!Note: As I''ve mentioned in previous postings, shrimp is both a healthy source of protein and cooks up quickly! My Diva Secret of the day is that I always keep a bag of frozen raw shrimp in my freezer to use in a pinch. It defrosts quickly and tastes delicious.Curried Shrimp with Brown Rice1 lb raw shrimp, peeled and deveined1 bell pepper, seeded and chopped1 onion, chopped2 garlic cloves, chopped1 tbsp fresh ginger1 tbsp curry powder1 cup tomatoes, chopped (I used yellow cherry tomatoes)1 cup low sodium vegetable broth or filtered water2 tbsp cilantro, chopped2 tbsp olive oilsalt & pepperrice:1 cup brown rice2 cups filtered water1 tbsp olive oil'),

('5882', '10', '655-7744Taking place on Sundays from 8am-1pm, this is a great market featuring a variety of vendors, including a few excellent organic ones, and lots of fun stuff for kids, such as a petting zoo and pony rides when I visited last week! I especially loved the specialty olive oil vendor and scooped up two bottles of locally made California olive oil! Stop by to taste test their olive oils and balsamic vinegars. A great alternative to the larger Hollywood Farmers Market if you''re looking for a smaller, easier to manage market.CLICK HERE TO VISIT THEIR WEBSITE!Source for Ingredients:black shrimp, organic bell pepper, organic onion, organic cilantro & organic yellow cherry tomatoes from Studio City Farmers Marketorganic garlic and ginger from Hollywood Farmers Marketorganic long grain brown rice from Whole Foodsorganic low sodium vegetable broth from Trader Joe''s'),

To test if the oil is hot enough, use tongs to hold one shrimp by the tail and submerge it in oil. if it sizzles and crackles, its ready. Working in batches so as not to crowd the pan, add the shrimp to the hot oil and fry, turning once, until golden brown. It should take between 40-60 seconds per side. if the shrimp are browning too quickly, turn the heat down a bit.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Arrange the shrimp on a platter and serve with the Sweet Red Chili Sauce.Note: I like to use unsweetened shredded coconut and add sugar to it, as opposed to sweetened flaked coconut, because it''s healthier, much easier to work with, and adds great texture to the dish.'),
