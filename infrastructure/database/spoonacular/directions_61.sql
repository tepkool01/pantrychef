('6900', '1', 'I think this recipe was born when I was looking for a way to use up leftover fish. Tilapia is a good friend to our kitchen, in part because they sell beautiful farm-raised tilapia at Costco in packages big enough for dinner plus leftovers. I also like its mildness and versatility. I''ve made versions of these fish cakes with salmon too, and that''s fine, but they definitely taste like salmon. The tilapia makes it more flexible in terms of seasonings.It does help to make the patties an hour or two in advance so they can firm up in the refrigerator before frying. They hold together better that way.My husband points out that the reason the kids like these is that they''re like big round fish sticks. I think of them more as crab cake stand-ins, but it doesn''t matter much. They disappear quickly in our house.Tilapia cakes with lemon-caper saucemakes 12 generous patties1/2 plus 1/4 cup mayonnaise, divided4 Tbsp capersjuice and zest of one lemon3 lbs tilapia fillets1 bunch scallions, chopped1 bell pepper, any color, chopped2 eggs1/2 cup breadcrumbs (dry or fresh)salt and pepper to tasteflour, for dredging patties before fryingolive oil, for frying'),
