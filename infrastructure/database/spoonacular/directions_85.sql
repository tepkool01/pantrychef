('8084', '1', 'This is a wonderfully simple, almost exotic light meal that fills you with a big smile. Make sure you get really fresh tuna  it needs to be red and almost waxy-looking. You can try using different fish, such as salmon, bream or scallops, just make sure theyre all really nice and fresh and smell of nothing but the sea.Get your tuna, and with a long sharp knife slice it as thinly as you can. Once youve sliced it, you can smooth it over with the side of your knife to make it even thinner. Divide this in one layer between your plates, or its even nicer to serve it on one big plate.Next, use this brilliant Japanese trick: cut a V-shaped vertical slit in the mooli and stuff the chilli in. This means that when you grate it you get a pink-coloured, chilli-flavoured radish pulp, which is fantastic. If you havent got mooli you can get the same effect by finely chopping the chilli and grating normal radishes.So, either grate or chop your mooli or radish and then blob it and its juice over the tuna slices and sprinkle over the shiso or coriander.When you serve it squeeze half a lime and a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce over each portion, to taste, then drizzle with a little olive oil.* Shiso is a Japanese herb with a strong flavour reminiscent of aniseed.Tip'),

('8172', '1', 'What the heck is Amaranth? Ya, I had no idea either a few weeks ago. I was at Whole Foods in the bulk section and was looking for the Farro, which is another amazing grain. I asked the very knowledgeable young lady if she had any other "favorite" grains and she turned me on to Amaranth. She was right! Amaranth is a grain originating from the Aztecs...a looong time ago. It is boiled with water or broth to make an almost, grits-like consistency. It has a nutty sweetness to it that makes it even great in the morning as a hot cereal with nuts and fruit! This recipe is a more savory recipe with a touch of butter and parmesan cheese. I served it as a bed to sauteed kale and grilled squid. The amaranth was my favorite part of the dish!P.S. This is a great gluten-free option and is LOADED with protein - nearly 14 grams per serving!Ingredients:-1 cup amaranth grains (not flour)-2.5 cups water or broth (veggie or chicken)-1 Tbsp butter, optional-1/8 cup shredded Parmesan cheese'),

It will be a consistency of grits or hot cereal.Once the amaranth is done cooking stir in the 1 Tbsp butter (you can use less or none at all) and 1/8 cup shredded Parmesan. Again you can use more or less of the cheese as well. Stir until blended and serve warm as a side dish with fish, chicken or meat. It makes for a very prettypresentationas a "bed" to your main dish. If you''re stuck on boring pasta or rice, try this much lower carb, protein-packed and gluten-free grain as an alternative.

So I think it depends on the pan and the range you are cooking with. Dont be discouraged if the grains dont pop right away, just adjust the temperature until you find the combination that works in your kitchen.Once all your amaranth is popped, place in a shallow bowl and set aside.

Christmas celebrated in a summer dress, well, "it ain''t fittin''. It jes'' ain''t fittin''" But there are signs that cannot be mistaken. Night falls earlier, the wind has finally picked up, the pecans are weighing the tree branches down. The light is now giving cold blue undertones, I put the diffuser back up in the studio, my shooting schedule has changed. Most importantly, the oven is buzzing with tarts, custards and cakes like these Double Chocolate And Pear Cakes, a gluten free adaptation of my mother''s recipe.I like spontaneity as much as I like certain family rituals. One that my folks have back home is to get together for tea time everyday around four or five o''clock. Even now that my grandmother is gone, my mother makes the same one yard walk to my grandfather''s and continues the tradition. One of my fondest memories is always this moment shared around their dining room table right when it is getting darker outside and we cozy up around a slice of cake and a hot cup of tea and chat.As a kid, I''d sit quietly and listen to a mix of conversations ranging from politics and literature to the more basic questions of what to cook for the next family get together. As a teenager I started taking part by bringing treats of my own like madeleines and langues de chats. As an adult, every time I go home, I just sit quietly and listen, literally captivated by every word they say, every event or family member they talk about. I try to encapsulate those precious moments for the long strips of time I spent away from them.Comes Fall when my "cozying-it-up" starts to kick in, I make this cake every weekend so that we can have tea and cake like they do back home. I have no idea where my mom got the original recipe, I just found several copies of it in different recipe tins around the house. I love it for the simple reason that you can make it your own with the flavor that you like. October might be cardamom and pistachios, November might give way to almond and vanilla while December might see some colorful candied fruits. Right now it''s pears and chocolate.After successfully adapting a chocolate tart recipe earlier this month to a gluten version, I thought my favorite cake would be next to become gluten free. The cake was not difficult to adapt using different flours and eggs and butter are there to help ingredients bind and raise properly. I mean, it''s hard to mess things up when there are eggs and butter. I added cocoa powder and melted dark chocolate to the batter and topped each cake with slices of ripe pears. I knew the flours could lend a different, sandy texture to the finished cakes so I slightly underbaked them so they''d remain moist for a couple of days.I purposely left out any kind of spice this time but I am thinking cardamom for the next cup of tea. I also want to try adapting this gorgeous Olive Oil Cake by Connie and these cute Nutella pound cakes by Dana. I can tell Fall is here...Double Chocolate And Pear Cakes:Makes five 3-inch cakes (I used these liners) or one loaf cake.1 stick (113gr)unsalted butter, at room temperature1/2 cup (100gr) sugar3 eggs2 oz (60gr) semisweet chocolate, melted and slightly cooled1/4 cup (60ml) buttermilk1/3 cup (60gr) sweet rice flour1/3 cup (60gr) sorghum flour (you could use amaranth or quinoa)OR 1 cup (125gr) all purpose flour instead, if not going gluten free3 tablespoons (15gr) cocoa powder1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder1 pear, ripe, peeled, pitted and thinly sliced'),
