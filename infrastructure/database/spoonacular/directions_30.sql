('3706', '1', 'Cioppino is said to have originated among fishermen who made their dinners out of the fish and shellfish they couldn''t sell in the morning.  Although it has evolved into a pricey item on upscale menus, at heart cioppino is comfort food.Traditionally cioppino features fresh crab, reflecting the origin of the dish in San Francisco where Dungeness crabs are plentiful.  When crab isn''t available or affordable, shrimp works just as well. Clams and mussels are essential to the dish, as are cubes of fish fillets.  Flounder sole, tilapia, salmon, or halibut all work well.Find a reliable supplier of seafood.  To ensure we''re getting the freshest ingredients, we buy our clams and mussels from Carlsbad Aqua Farm at the Santa Monica Farmers'' Market (Wednesday and Sunday) and our flounder sole from Tropical Seafood at the Pacific Palisades Farmers'' Market (Sunday).Tomatoes are as important to making cioppino as is good quality seafood.  If the tomatoes are roasted, the soup has a beautiful sweetness edged with the tomato''s natural acidity.One of the helpful aspects of this dish is that many of the elements can be prepared ahead and frozen for later use.  I pick up overly ripe tomatoes at the Santa Monica Farmers'' Market when they''re discounted.  I''ll buy several pounds, roast them, freezing some whole in an air tight container and turning the rest into tomato sauce, which I also freeze.The clams and mussels can be cooked, taken out of their shells,  and frozen.  If the meat is submerged in the broth, there''s no danger of freezer burn.  The fish fillets can be cut into 1/2" squares, tossed in olive oil, and frozen in a Ziploc bag.   That way all the essential parts of the cioppino are waiting in the freezer whenever you want a taste treat.Cioppino with Roasted Tomatoes'),

When the butter mixture is first added to the bread, if you taste it at this point it might seem salty (because it is sitting right on the surface of the bread) but remember that the liquid and butter soaks into the bread and redistributes evenly. Also, this recipe, being from the 1950s, is specifically for cooking *inside* the turkey, which a lot of people no longer do, and again the salt will redistribute from the juices in the meat. If you use a crockpot for cooking your stuffing, I''d recommend reducing the amount of salt.Note #2: again, regarding the salt. You''re going to have to decide for yourself about the salt.
