('7980', '2', 'Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine. Taste and add more water as desired to adjust the strength of the sauce.Make the summer rolls: Start by dipping a rice-paper wrapper in warm water for about 5 seconds. Long enough to slightly soften, but not so long that they tear or become difficult to work with. You will notice that they begin to get pliable and transparent. This is your indicator that they have been in the water long enough. They will continue to soften after they leave the water, so don’t over soak them.Getting a picture perfect roll starts with a solid base. Begin by laying the moistened wrapper onto a plate or work surface. Lay 3 or 4 lettuce pieces, about ¼ cup matchstick veggies, and a few mint leaves  in a small elongated pile at the bottom third of the wrapper, centered side to side. Getting a tight roll depends on this step, so make sure to arrange these ingredients into a firm cylinder. The exact size depends on the wrapper you are using and should be about half of the overall diameter.Fold each side of the wrapper inwards, meeting in the center. Fold the bottom flap of the cylinder up and over the ingredients. Creating a vertical rectangle with a rounded top. Be precise with your folds. They are hard to redo due to the sticky nature of the wrapper.Working from the bottom, maintaining a neat uniform shape, roll the wrapper 1/2 turn so that the lettuce and veggies are facing up.'),
('7980', '3', 'Place 2 or 3 slices of tuna tataki and a few more veggies and sprigs of mint in a line just above the wrapped cylinder of rolled ingredients. Keep in mind that these are the ingredients that will have a window on the world so choose them well and arrange them artistically. You may trim the ingredients to fit inside the roll, or you may let them overhang one or both sides, depending on your presentation and aesthetic.Continue to roll the rest of the way. If you come across any stiff sections of the rice-paper, simply moisten them with a wet finger, and do the same for the final edge to seal it. Repeat with the other wrappers.'),
