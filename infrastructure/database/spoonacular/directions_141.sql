Before cooking, remove the food from the container and shake off the excess liquid. Cook on a lightly oiled grill to the desired doneness. Tips: Although you can marinate food in almost any kind of container (but avoid reactive metals, like unlined aluminum and cast iron), it''s best to use 1-gallon resealable plastic bags. They allow the liquid to surround the food completely, ensuring better absorption. Plus, cleanup is a cinch.Toss a marinade once youve soaked raw meat in it. The mixture may be contaminated with bacteria.Best With: London broil, pork tenderloin, pork chops, shrimp, salmon, bell peppers, eggplant, and mushrooms.'),
