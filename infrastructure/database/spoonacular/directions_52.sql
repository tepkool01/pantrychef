('6103', '2', 'On Saturday, I had the privilege of attending the Buick Regal Discovery Tour at the SLS Hotel, sponsored by Food & Wine and Travel + Leisure magazines. Los Angeles was the final stop on the cross-country tour, which began in Chicago and hit cities including Orlando, Dallas, and Cincinnati. I guess they saved the best for last!Our stop featured guest speakers, including Jorge A. Chicas, the executive chef of The Bazaar by Jose Andres (one of my favorite LA restaurants), mixology expert Michael Green, road food guru Michael Stern, and Top Chef Master Marcus Samuelsson.The Bazaar''s Liquid Olives'),
('6103', '3', 'After test driving a 2011 Buick Regal (not a bad way to begin a cold Los Angeles morning -- the car even has seat warmers!), my group entered a conference room, where we were greeted by Chef Chicas, his sous chef, and a table full of molecular gastronomy delights.Chef Chicas showed us how to make tomato and watermelon skewers, demonstrated the technique for The Bazaar''s famous liquid olives (encapsulated olive juice that explodes in your mouth), and passed around liquid olives for us to taste. He also answered questions and spoke at length about The Bazaar''s new upscale tasting room, Saam, which I can''t wait to try in the new year.'),

('6103', '5', 'Next up, we were greeted enthusiastically by mixology expert Michael Green, who demonstrated how to make a Ginger Gin Sour Cocktail (we mixed the mocktail version, but were promised the real deal later in the day to sip for Marcus Samuelsson''s presentation). Not only did Michael work the room like a pro, but he demonstrated an astounding depth of knowledge on everything from the perfect drinks to serve for holiday brunch (low alcohol wine like Riesling or Prosecco cocktails), to perfect wine pairings, to essential bar tools. Then, we hit the road (metaphorically) with road food aficionado Michael Stern, who writes the wonderful website Road Food. He spoke about the best way to find great food (hint -- roll down your windows and use your nose), his favorite BBQ dives, and his recent meal at Phillippe the Original in downtown L.A. (read his review here). The next time I plan a road trip, I''ll be using his website to find great places to stop for grub along the way.Chef Marcus Samuelsson'),
('6103', '6', 'The foodie extravaganza came to an end with Chef Marcus Sameulsson''s cooking demonstration. We were handed Michael Green''s Ginger Gin Sour Cocktail, suffused with gin this time, and ushered into a large conference. The second I entered the room, I was bowled over by the delicious smells emanating from the stage -- fragrant and potent, hinting at powerful spices and complex flavor profiles.After taking a seat, we were served steaming hot bowls of Chef Samuelsson''s version of Shrimp and Red Grits (recipe below). The savory dish was packed with flavors (spicy, sweet, umami) and textures (grits, shrimp, tomatoes). No wonder he won Top Chef Masters -- I can''t wait to try making this recipe at home.Chef Samuelsson answered a number of questions from the audience, offering advice on essential cupboard spices and cookware, waxing poetic about the superiority of California''s farmers markets (sorry New Yorkers!), and complimenting the meal he has last night at Animal (interestingly, the last time I dined there, Chef Samuelsson ate at the table next to me with fellow masters Jonathan Waxman and Rick Moonen -- my review and pics here)."New American Table" by Marcus Samuelsson'),
