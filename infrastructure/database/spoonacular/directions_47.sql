It tastes like celery only more so. The stems are hollow unlike the celery you are mostly likely used to and can be woody. The trick is to focus on the leaves and the stems directly connected, it is the most tender and flavorful part of the plant. In this dish, the celery-riffic taste contrasts with the sweet-sour flavor of the tamarind sauce and the sweet shrimp to make for a dish that tastes complex yet comforting at the same time.'),

You can find dishes from nearly very providence in China as well as Japanese, British, Indian and American-influenced dishes. Since Bravo''s Around the World in 80 Plates will be in Hong Kong this week (June 27th, 10/9c)I thought it would be a fun chance to make one of my favorite Cantonese dishes, which is easy to find in Hong Kong, lightly coated, crisp salt and pepper shrimp. It is traditionally found at dinnertime (steamed dishes like dumplings are the ones found earlier in the day, during yum cha) at one of the many dim sum restaurants.I modified the dish a bit from being absolutely traditional to make it more "user friendly". I peeled the shrimp instead of leaving the shells on and used cornstarch instead of harder-to-find rice flour but the end result is wonderful. Spicy and salty and crunchy. They are super fun to make in a wok but if your wok frying skills aren''t the best, you can fry the whole batch at once in a large heavy bottomed skillet.Sichuan peppercorns are know for their "numbing hot" tendencies, they make your tongue and lips tingle a bit while providing their signature citrus-y flavor. Store the leftover salt/pepper mixture in an airtight container for the next time you make salt and pepper shrimp (or try it on popcorn!).'),
