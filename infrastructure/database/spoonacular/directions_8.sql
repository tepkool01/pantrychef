It''s not the best---I''ve never been all that good at food photography---but while I scrolled through the newest downloads on the computer this morning, I started chuckling when I came to this picture.It''s fish. On a fish plate.When Adam and I went to Crate and Barrel to register prior to our wedding, he scanned in this fish platter. I thought it was hideous.HIDEOUS.but he wanted it, and was certain that somebody would buy it, even with the $120 price tag. It certainly wasn''t worth arguing over, so I held my cringe as he happily "zapped" it with the registry gun.I don''t remember which of our guests bought this platter, but I do know that this fish has been lovingly packed in bubble wrap each time we''ve moved, and we find every opportunity we can to bring it to the table. A platter of brownies? put ''em on the fish. Cheese and crackers? put ''em on the fish. How about strawberries and grapes? put ''em on the fish. It makes me smile every single time.The Ingredients.serves 2I took this picture prematurely.

And yup, if you''d rather use up the lemons on your tree, go ahead and use them! It''s all good.This was enough fish for me and Adam and the girls, but would really only fill up two adults.
