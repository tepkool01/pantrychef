('2521', '1', 'Did you know that cod used to be a very highly prized, valuable trading commodity? Wars and battles were won on salt cod because, of course, in the old days ships were sailing for weeks or months and the sailors would have a very unhealthy diet. Having salt cod on board as a source of protein kept them going, and it meant they could jump off the boat with enough energy for a bit of fighting when it was required! All kinds of cultures began to salt fish  I suppose Iberian and Nordic countries are particularly well known for still doing it today. And certainly the Italians are more than partial to their fair share of it. Hundreds of years ago the only way to get fish into the centre of Italy would have been to use preserved fish like salt cod. It might sound obvious, but this is why Tuscan cooking is predominantly meat- and bean-based. In the old days the only common fish recipes would have used either preserved or fresh lake fish.Unless you live in a country where its prevalent, like Portugal or Spain, salt cod can only be bought in good delis. Try to hunt out the real baccal, but if you cant find any then simply buy some fresh fish which can be salted overnight. As salt cod is preserved using copious amounts of salt, avoid seasoning this soup at all or do it right at the very end.If using fresh cod, haddock or monkfish, pack it in a few handfuls of sea salt overnight and rinse it before using. If using proper salt cod, soak the fillets in cold water for 24 hours, changing the water a few times during this period. This way, the fish will rehydrate and the saltiness will be removed before cooking. If the fish is more than 2cm thick it might need up to 36 hours soaking.Chop the onion, carrots, celery, garlic and parsley stalks.'),

Heres what you do: with a paring knife, cut the tops and bottoms from the orange so it sits flat. Then cut off the peel and the pith all around, so you have a naked-looking orange. Holding this in your left hand, use a smaller knife to cut around each section, letting the juice drip into the salad bowl and dropping sections in as you go. If this sound impossible, skip the orange, or peel off the pith in some other manner.thats not Cara! Pictured: fruit salad and Jill in Caras chef hat'),
