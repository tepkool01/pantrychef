You probably don''t need me to remind you, but let me anyway: it is important that each ladleful is absorbed before you add the next one.Meanwhile, put the quail''s eggs in a pan of cold water and bring to the boil. Once the water''s come to the boil, drain the eggs and put them in a bowl of cold water, running the tap for a while over them to make sure they stop cooking.Once you have reached the right point with the risotto, and the rice is done, add the fish, minimally flaked with a fork or your fingers, to the rice along with the remaining butter and the lemon juice, beating well, off the heat, with your wooden spoon to make sure everything is creamy and well amalgamated.
