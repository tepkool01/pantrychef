I love making pretty much anything in the crockpot, but the ease of making fish is just so wonderful, I''m surprised everyone doesn''t cook fish this way.It''s easy.It''s moist and flavorful.It doesn''t heat up the house on a hot day.it doesn''t stink up the kitchen.and clean up is practically non-existent.SCORE!I had a bunch of frozen tilapia in the house that I bought in bulk, and needed a new recipe. My kids hands-down favorite tialpia is Parmesan Tilapia, but I wanted a super low-fat dinner to counteract the gobs of Cheesy Creamed Corn I ate the other day.The Ingredients.serves 44 tilapia filets (frozen is just fine)2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar1 tablespoon honey1 (10-ounce) can mandarin oranges, drainedaluminum foilsalt and pepper to taste at the table'),
('6936', '2', 'The Directions.Use a 6-quart slow cooker. Lay a length of foil on your countertop and place the fish directly in the middle. Dribble balsamic vinegar and honey over the top of each fillet, and place a handful of drained mandarin oranges on top (my kids like to drink the juice!).Fold over foil and crimp the edges to form a packet.'),
('6936', '3', 'Put the foil packet into your slow cooker, and put the lid on (if you''d prefer to have one fish fillet per packet for serving, divide the sauce and the oranges). Cook on high for two hours, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. If your fish was frozen, it may take another 30 minutes or so, but you should still check it after two hours. Season to taste with some salt and pepper at the table.The Verdict.We all loved this, and I was able to share my grandfather''s story about  mandarin oranges really being boneless baby goldfish. It''s a bit  odd---but the kids loved the story the same way I did when I was growing  up!more fish in foil:fillet of sole with pestosalmon with a sweet and spicy rub'),
