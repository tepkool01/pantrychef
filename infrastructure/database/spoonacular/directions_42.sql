First, take a serrated knife (steak knife) and make a slit lengthwise in the salmon fillets without cutting all the way through. Basically make a little pocket.I found the best way to stuff the salmon with the cream cheese is to cut small slices from the block and press into pieces about the length of the salmon.

You can adjust the mayo to be spicy or sweeter depending on yourpalette.You could just drizzle the mayo on top of the salmon or you could pipe it through a plastic baggy. Just put a few tablespoons in a small plastic bag and snip off a corner.When the salmon is done, pull it out, sprinkle with green onions and drizzle with spicy mayo! I promise, this will be a melt-in-your-mouth dish! The greatest part is that the marinade can be saved (just boil it after being used and put in the fridge) and the spicy mayo can be saved as well.  If you want to make the dish in a week or two all you need is the salmon, cream cheese and green onions! You could use the marinade for chicken or any other fish. I''m sure you could get creative with the spicy mayo too. ;)Pin It'),

So while suffering from extreme jet lag, I snapped up some lovely wild king salmon steaks at Whole Foods and carted them home along with some scallions, broccoli and russet potatoes.Usually I buy based on quality of ingredients with only a loose idea of how I''ll prepare the food and then I wait for inspiration to strike. Well, it did last night, and I decided to grill the fish and glaze it with a homemade teriyaki sauce (a sweet soy sauce). I also grilled up some scallions and served the fish along with steamed broccoli and baked potatoes topped with lemon juice and pimenton.This was the perfect welcome home dinner - easy, healthy and delicious. Even better, I have some leftover salmon that I''ll eat for lunch over an arugula, tomato and cucumber salad.
