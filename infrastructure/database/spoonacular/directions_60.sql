('6771', '1', 'Happy Friday Divas!Here''s the deal. We should all eat more fish.Not only more fish, but fish that''s sustainable, low in mercury, in this economy, affordable, and oh yeah, tasty, too.Whew!Is anyone else overwhelmed by all the requirements? Making good dietary choices can be like navigating through a minefield without losing a limb (did you see the ads and read about the new Taco Bell Drive-Thru Diet?!). One of the most readily available fish in the supermarket is farm-raised Tilapia. It''s tasty, easy to cook up and inexpensive. But does it meet the above guidelines?I''ve done the research, and while there are some asterisks that I''ll discuss, the answer is yes.  Seafood Watch rates farm-raised tilapia a "best" choicewhen it''s raised in the United States. It''s high in protein and an excellent source of phosphorus, niacin, selenium, vitamin B12, and a good source of potassium. It''s also exceptionally budget-friendly, which is important. However, unlike the touted salmon, farm-raised tilapia is not a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. But this isn''t the poor little tilapia''s fault - rather it''s caused by the corn-based food most farm-raised fish are fed (this is the same reason why our meat supply is so unhealthy). You are what you eat, and this holds true for fish as much as people. Wild fish eat a diet rich in algae, which is the reason they contain so many omega-3''s, which then trickle up the food chain to us (by the way, the same holds true for grass-fed meat). So this could be corrected by reforming our farming practices to feed the fish a diet rich in omega-3''s. It''s that simple. But when you consider all the choices out there and shake it out, I believe that tilapia can be part of a healthy, varied diet. Just make sure you scoop up a handful of walnuts to get your daily dose of omega-3''s from another source.Here''s a fast recipe that I whip up from time to time. While I made it with tilapia, it would be great with catfish or snapper, too. I serve the blackened fish over a quick soft polenta. Just pair this meal with a veggie and you''re all set (I recommend my Roasted Broccoli with Garlic and Parmesan Reggiano). Also, don''t forget to click click click away on my blog Domestic Divas!

It tasted fresh & delicious and the chili is not overpowering. Michael, who has never been a fan of fish, ate the entire piece and said, "You know honey, I really didn''t think I was going to like this... but it''s great!"Personally, I loved the addition of peach salsa on the fish to give a tiny bit of sweetness to cut the heat of the chili.

Not only did the black beans look great paired with the bright yellow mango, but the flavors in this salsa went perfectly with the mild-flavored Tilapia. I''m always in favor of recipes that combine lime and cilantro, so having that added to the mix didn''t hurt a bit.Mangos grow on trees, and there are more than 1,000 cultivars of mango growing in Indian, North America, South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. They are often used in chutney and mango salsa, and mangos are eaten ripe and unripe both in many parts of the world. You''re probably used to seeing bright yellow fruit on mangos, but the fruit can also be orange or red, depending on the variety of mango. Whatever color, most mango varieties are sweet and juicy, and mangos are a good source of fiber, and are rich in many vitamins and minerals.
