('27865', '32', 'Simple syrup is the name given to sugar dissolved in water. It is not enough to just stir some sugar in water. it has to be lightly heated so that the sugar actually dissolves. This is done to avoid a gritty texture. ADVANCE PREPARATIONThis is definitely a recipe that must be prepared ahead of time because the ices need several hours to freeze properly. After the ices have been frozen, they can be scraped, placed in airtight containers, and frozen until neededthe texture will be fine. The frozen ices can be kept in the freezer for a few weeks. If you are keeping your ices frozen, prevent the ice from absorbing flavors from the freezer by completely wrapping the storage containers with plastic wrap. This will ensure an airtight environment.'),
